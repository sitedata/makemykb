PayPal offers customers the ability to pay recurring invoices automatically using a "Subscription" payment, authorising PayPal to take money from your account when an invoice is due.

You are responsible for maintaining this subscription as a customer, so if you cancel your service you must also cancel any PayPal subscriptions associated with the service. 

Follow the steps below to cancel a PayPal subscription.

* Step 1. Log in to your PayPal account.

* Step 2. Navigate to the "Payments" page.
