**MakeMyKB** is a project that aims to provide easily importable knowledgebase articles for web hosting companies using Blesta.

The articles are developed and pushed to this repo in Markdown format and completed articles are then pasted into a Blesta installation and exported from there as an SQL format to be used elsewhere.

The main categories covered will be:
* Blesta
* CloudFlare
* cPanel
* DirectAdmin
* Plesk
* WHMCS

**MakeMyKB** is completely free and provided independently by MichaelCee.xyz
