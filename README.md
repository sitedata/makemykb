MakeMyKB provides free web hosting knowledge base articles in a downloadable format for companies using Blesta. 

It's completely free and you're welcome to make any adjustments you wish or submit requests.

The project has been restarted as of August 2021 and is currently in development. 

Articles will be posted here in .md format as they're developed and SQL packs will be released here when available.
